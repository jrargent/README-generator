# README-generator

## Description

This is a README generator that is meant to help the user quickly generate a README file. It uses node.js to prompt the user to answer questions in the terminal. The program then writes the user's inputs into a template and creates a README.md file.

## Things I learned in this project

- Using node.js
- Using npm and installing modules
- I gained a better understanding of template literals as well as descronstructing objects.
- I need to be better about creating branches on my repo when I move to working on different features. I ended up writing most of the file generation and template while on the features/questions branch as I forgot to create a new branch.
